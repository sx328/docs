# Licenses

## What is a license?

A license is a unique code that a customer can use to access the dashboard. Licenses can be purchased or manually created through the dashboard.

## Creating licenses

To create a license, log into your dashboard and head to the `/admin` page. Click `New` next to "Licenses," and a modal will pop up. Select a plan and click "Create" and your license will appear immediately in the table below.

## Revoking licenses

When you revoke a license, a few things happen:

* If it is a recurring license, the subscription is immediately cancelled
* If the license has been bound, the user is immediately kicked from the server and logged out of the dashboard

Revoking a license is a permanent action and cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

To revoke an individual license, click the three dots in the table row and click "Revoke." To revoke multiple licenses, select them and then under "Actions" select "Revoke."
