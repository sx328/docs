# Releases

## What is a release?

Releases define the plan, stock, and password for purchase links. Using releases, you can create controlled waves of purchases for your service. Say, for example, you wanted to release 100 licenses that renew weekly, and make this release available only to followers of a specific Twitter account. You could create a release with an initial stock of 100 and a password of your choice, then tweet the purchase link.

## Creating releases

To create a plan, log into your dashboard and head to the `/admin` page. Click `New` next to "Releases," and a modal will pop up with some basic release options:

* **Plan** to release \(see [**Plans**](plans.md)\)
* **Stock** to release
* **Password** to include in the purchase link

## Pulling stock

If you create a release with an initial stock of 50, but decide you want to disallow purchasing after 25 purchases, you can click the three dots next to the release and click "pull stock." This will immediately decrease available stock to zero and block any more users from purchasing.
