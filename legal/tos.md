**1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**

**1.1** **Overview.** The following terms of service \("TOS"\) govern your use of and purchases through \(a\) the metalabs.io website \(including all web pages, sub-domains and sub-parts therein contained, the "Site"\), and \(b\) any and all services available on or through the Site or otherwise provided by Meta Labs, LLC \( “Meta Labs”\) \(collectively, the "Services"\). Except as set forth herein, the Services are owned and operated by Meta Labs. The Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site by Meta Labs.

**1.2 Modification.** Meta Labs reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the terms or conditions of this TOS at any time.

If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease accessing and otherwise using the Services.

**2. DESCRIPTION OF META LABS.**

Meta Labs provides software, services, tools and APIs to enable you to manage and use various Internet properties, including Discord servers, including modules that allow you to sell licenses and manage access to or use your properties to your end users. You may use the Services to bill and collect payments directly from your end users. Payments are all transacted through Meta Labs’ integration with your account on the Stripe payment processing platform \(the "Gateway"\). All payment processing services for Meta Labs are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service \(collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”\). By agreeing to the TOS or continuing to operate as an account holder on the Services, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Meta Labs enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Meta Labs accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Meta Labs to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

{% hint style="info" %}
**4. BILLING, PAYMENT, CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS.**

**4.1 Payments and Subscriptions.** There are various payment and subscription options available for using the Services. These options can be found in the individual Services descriptions and may change from time to time. Once your initial payment is processed, your subscription to the Services has begun, and you can immediately access the relevant Services. IN ADDITION TO ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES OR OTHER CHARGES, YOU AGREE THAT ANY APPLICATION OR TRANSACTION FEES THAT MAY BE IN PLACE WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THE GATEWAY, MAY BE CARRIED OVER TO \(AND COLLECTED AND RETAINED BY\) META LABS, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT META LABS MAY KEEP ALL SUCH FEES.

**4.2 Automatic Renewals.** Subscriptions automatically renew. This means that once you sign up for the Services, your subscription will automatically renew based on the subscription program you chose \(e.g. semiannually, monthly, etc.\). Your credit card on file will be charged the rate stated at the time of purchase \(plus applicable taxes\) at the beginning of each billing term of your subscription. You are responsible for keeping a valid credit card number on file and for ensuring that your billing information is correct to prevent your subscription from lapsing. Our pricing may change at any time. The price and terms in place when you made your initial purchase or when your subscription last renewed will stay in effect for the duration of that subscription period, but new prices and terms may apply to renewals or new subscriptions. Meta Labs will give you reasonable notice of any change in price or terms before they go into effect. If you do not want to renew your subscription under these new prices or terms, you may cancel your subscription as described below.

**4.3 Services Cancellations and Refunds.** You may cancel the Services by logging into your dashboard page on the Site or by contacting us by email. All refunds will be credited to your credit card on file. The following terms will apply:

     a. Monthly Subscriptions: Subscriptions billed on a monthly basis may be canceled at any time prior to two business days before your renewal date but are not eligible for a refund. If you cancel your monthly subscription, you will retain access to the Services for the remainder of that month. If you do not cancel your subscription prior to two days before your renewal date, Meta Labs will renew your subscription for one more month.

     b. Subscriptions Longer than a Month: Subscriptions longer than one month may be canceled during the first 30 days for a refund of any prepaid fees beyond the fees for the first 30 day period. If you cancel this type of subscription after the first 30 days, you will not receive a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be canceled. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, Meta Labs will renew your subscription for an additional term equivalent in length to your current subscription. Refunds are not based on account usage.

**4.4 Additional Services.** You are also responsible for, and Meta Labs is authorized to charge your credit card for, any additional Services that you authorize, whether verbally or in writing \(including via email\), such as the purchase of additional modules, additional services or customization services. Meta Labs reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to accept or decline requests for additional modules, additional services or customization services.

**4.5 End User Payments.** Meta Labs’ sole role with respect to payments is to provide access to the Gateway to facilitate processing of payments for licenses administered through the Services. All such payments are collected directly from the end user by you via your account with the Gateway and are not collected by Meta Labs. You, and not Meta Labs, are responsible for calculating and collecting all applicable taxes from end users based on transactions processed using the Services. All communications and disputes regarding payments are solely between you and your end user, and Meta Labs is not responsible or liable in any way for, and you will hold Meta Labs harmless from any rejected payments, incorrect charges, chargebacks or any other transaction failure in connection with your use of the Services, even if performed by Meta Labs on your behalf.

**4.6 End User Refunds.** It is your responsibility to communicate your refund policy to end users and to issue refunds to end users via the Site or otherwise in accordance with that policy. All communications or disputes regarding chargebacks or refunds are solely between you and the end user, and Meta Labs will not be responsible or liable in any way for chargebacks, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with your use of the Services, even if performed by Meta Labs on your behalf. Communications to Meta Labs concerning payments, refunds or chargebacks will not be answered and will not be forwarded to you. Meta Labs shall not be bound by your refund policy, whether or not such policy is communicated to end users on or through the Site.

{% hint style="info" %}
**20. LEGAL DISPUTES**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND META LABS HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.**

You and Meta Labs agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and Meta Labs \(including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of Meta Labs\) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of these TOS, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Meta Labs or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section.

a. Applicable Law

You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Meta Labs, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.

b. Agreement to Arbitrate

You and Meta Labs each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Meta Labs \(including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of Meta Labs\) that relate in any way to or arise out of this Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of Meta Labs or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual \(non-class, non-representative\) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.

c. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND META LABS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND META LABS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF \(INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF\) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM\(S\). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim \(and only that claim\) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Meta Labs' right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.

d. Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the portion of this Agreement entitled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief", shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association \("AAA"\) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules \(as applicable\), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement. 

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a Notice of Dispute \("Notice"\). The Notice to Meta Labs should be sent to Meta Labs at the address set forth in the Notice section above. Meta Labs will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Meta Labs account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.

If you and Meta Labs are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Meta Labs may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Meta Labs at the address set forth in the Notice section above. In the event Meta Labs initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Meta Labs account. Any settlement offer made by you or Meta Labs shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Meta Labs may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Meta Labs subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Meta Labs may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Meta Labs user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

e. Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.

f. Severability

With the exception of any of the provisions in the Section entitled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief", if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.

g. Future Amendments to this Section

Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Legal Disputes Section \(other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein\) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Meta Labs prior to the effective date of the amendment.

h. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes

You and Meta Labs agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
