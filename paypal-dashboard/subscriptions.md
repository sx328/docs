# Subscriptions and Licenses

## What is a license?

A license is a unique code that a customer can use to access the dashboard. Licenses can be purchased or manually created through the admin dashboard.

## What is a subscription?

A subscription, also seen as **recurring payment** on PayPal, is a payment that happens on regular intervals \(for example weekly, monthly or yearly\).

## How do I create a subscription?

1. Head over to your PayPal dashboard, [**quick link**](https://www.paypal.com/mep/dashboard).
2. You should see a button leading to the recurring payments page, [**quick link**](https://www.paypal.com/it/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_button-designer&factory_type=subscribe).
3. Set the details of your subscription and **store the ID**, you will need to input it on the Meta Labs dashboard in order to restock with that specific subscription, see how to do it [**here**](https://docs.metalabs.io/paypal-dashboard/coming-soon).

{% hint style="warning" %}
To create subscriptions/recurring payments you will need **PayPal** **Business** account.
{% endhint %}

## How do you bind a subscription to a specific user?

Upon successful purchase, the user will receive an email containing a **license** and a link to the **activation page**. After authenticating with Discord, and inputting a valid license, the user will be redirected to the dashboard and automatically added to your server with roles of your choosing.

## What happens when the user cancels the subscription?

If the user cancels the subscription we will notify you in the PayPal log channel and update the user's status as **cancelled**. 

Our bot will automatically kick the user once the period of time he paid for expires.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Cancelling a subscription is a **permanent** action and cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}
