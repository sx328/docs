## What is Meta Labs?

{% hint style="success" %}
According to Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries, a **proxy server** is:

_**A server that exists between somebody's personal computer and the Internet** to provide some services for the user and/or to prevent them from reaching information, websites, etc. without permission._

As the description goes, a proxy is like a middle man between your computer or local network and larger scale networks. You can use it for multiple purposes – from improving security to monitoring your online activities.

## What are the advantages of residential proxies?

{% hint style="success" %}
A residential proxy is an intermediary that uses an IP address provided by an Internet Service Provider \(ISP\), not a data center. Each residential proxy address has a physical location. And even though billions of digital devices connect to the internet at any time, their **IP addresses can pinpoint the location of any device**. So, every time you go online, you give out information about your browser preferences, cookies and get logged with your real IP address.
{% endhint %}

## Which types of residential proxies do you offer?

{% hint style="success" %}
We currently offer **Static**, also known as **Sticky**, and **Rotating** proxies.

## What's the difference between Static and Rotating proxies?

{% hint style="success" %}
**Static Proxy**

It's a type of proxy that gives its user the same IP address \(for up to 10 minutes\) for every connection request.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Rotating Proxy**

It's a type of proxy that gives its user a new IP address for every connection request.
